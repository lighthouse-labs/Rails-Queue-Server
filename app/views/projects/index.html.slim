  | Projects are apps that you will be building during the bootcamp. Multiple activities in the schedule will work together to help you incrementally build each app. There are 7 projects in total, two of which are group projects (midterm and final project).

    h4 Evaluation

    p
      | The five individual projects are a core part of your learning experience and also how you will be evaluated during this program. Each project has an evaluation rubric consisting of functional requirements as well as learning outcomes that must be satisfied.

    p
      | Upon completion of a project, it must be submitted for review at which point a mentor will perform a code and functional review of your app to make sure that it passes the evaluation rubric. In the case that it does not pass, you will be expected to fix and re-submit your project until it does.

    p
      | All five projects must be completed and approved in order to graduate from the bootcamp. They are a big deal.
