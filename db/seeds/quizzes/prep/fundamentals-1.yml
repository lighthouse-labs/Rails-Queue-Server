        answer: "`5 * \"3\"`"
        explanation: "Using the `*` operator on a number and a string will convert the string into a number and multiply them, resulting in a new number."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`5 + \"3\"`"
        explanation: "Using the `+` operator on a number and a string will convert the number into a string and concatenate them, resulting in a new string."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "5 % \"3\""
        explanation: "Using the `%` operator on a number and a string will convert the string into a number and calculate the remainder of their division, resulting in a new number."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "None of these expressions will result in a number"
        explanation: ""
        correct: false

    question: |
      What is the result of the following expression?

      ```javascript
      "15" === 15
      ```

    options_attributes:
      -
        answer: "`true`"
        explanation: "The strict equals operator (`===`) will compare the two operands and return `true` only when they both have the same value and are of the same type. In our case, `\"15\"` is a string and `15` a number – different types, therefore they are not equal to one another."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`false`"
        explanation: "The string `\"15\"` and the number `15` may look the same to us, but to JavaScript they are different types. Therefore comparing them using the strict equals operator (`===`) will return `false`."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "It will throw an error because they are not the same types."
        explanation: "The strict operator `===` is not that strict. It should still be able to do a comparison, just a strict comparison where the types have to match."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`undefined` because they are not the same types."
        explanation: "Comparison expressions do their best effort to be true/false (boolean)"
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`null` because they are not the same types."
        explanation: "Comparison expressions do their best effort to be true/false (boolean)"
        correct: false

    question: |
      What will be logged to the console by the following code?

      ```javascript
      var a = 3;
      var b = 4;
      b = a;
      console.log(b);
      ```

    options_attributes:
      -
        answer: "3"
        explanation: "We're declaring two variables, `a` and `b`, and setting their values to `3` and `4` respectively. However, then we're re-assigning `b` to the value of `a`, namely `3`, before logging its value."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "4"
        explanation: "We're declaring a variable `b` and setting its value to `4`, but then we re-assign `b` to point to the value of `a`, namely `3`, before logging its value."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`false`"
        explanation: "The `=` operator sets values to variables. We've set the value of `b` to equal that of `a` – we're not comparing the two against each other."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "The third line will throw an error so we will not see the output of `b`"
        explanation: "The `=` operator sets values to variables. We've set the value of `b` to equal that of `a`. There is no cause for concern by JavaScript here."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`undefined` because it can be either 3 or 4."
        explanation: "We're declaring a variable `b` and setting its value to `4`, but then we re-assign `b` to point to the value of `a`, namely `3`, before logging its value."
        correct: false

    question: |
      Given the following code, which of the following expressions checks whether the value of `number` is even?

      ```javascript
      var number = 2 + 2;
      ```

    uuid: 12246e5b-077c-40b1-8851-af6ffab56644
    outcome: 02cbdb28-5006-49d9-888b-8a9d740a942b
    options_attributes:
      -
        answer: "`number === \"even\"`"
        explanation: "The value of `number` is the number `4`, which is even but not equal to the string `\"even\"`."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`number % 2 === 0`"
        explanation: "All even numbers divide by `2` without any remainder – odd numbers don't. Therefore, if the remainder of dividing `4` into `2` is equal to `0`, we know `4` is even."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "`number === 2`"
        explanation: "Even numbers divide evenly into `2` – they are not equal to `2`."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`number.even?`"
        explanation: "Incorrect. That will work in Ruby, but JS does not have the .even? method."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`number.isEven()`"
        explanation: "Incorrect. This method is something that JS _could_ have offered, but doesn't actually have."
        correct: false

    options_attributes:
      -
        answer: "`\"Bob\"` because the first value is non-empty and causes a short curcuit."
        explanation: ""
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "`\"Marley\"` because it is the last value in the chain"
        explanation: ""
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`\"Bob Marley\"` because of the concatenation operator between them"
        explanation: "`||` is not for concatenation but rather an OR operator."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`true` since at least one (in this case both) values are non-empty"
        explanation: "Please read up on 'short-curcuiting again of logical operators' again"
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "None of the options are correct"
        explanation: "Please read up on 'short-curcuiting again of logical operators' again"
        correct: false

    options_attributes:
      -
        answer: "It will throw an error because comparing strings in this way is not possible"
        explanation: "Incorrect. Strings are indeed comparable."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`false`"
        explanation: "It will compare each character and since right off the bat J does not come after K, it is not a 'greater'."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "`true`"
        explanation: ""
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`122`"
        explanation: "Comparison operators like < and > produce only boolean values. Please review them again."

    options_attributes:
      -
        answer: "`\"Don\"` and `\"Burks\"` on separate lines, since `\\n` is a newline character."
        explanation: "That's correct. Each `\\n` is like hitting enter on the keyboard. Two together would create an empty line between the two words here."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "`\"Don\"` and `\"skruB\"`, since `\\n` will reverse anything that follows."
        explanation: "Incorrect. `\\n` is indeed an escaped, special character. But it does not trigger a reversal."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "Just `\"Don\"`, since `\\n` terminates the rest of the string, ie ignoring what follows."
        explanation: "Incorrect. `\\n` is indeed an escaped, special character. But it does not terminate the string."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`\"DonBurks\"` since any characters with `\\` before them are escaped and therefore ignored."
        explanation: "Incorrect. `\\n` is indeed an escaped, special character, but it does something and is _not_ ignored."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "\"Don\\nBurks\" just like we see it there"
        explanation: "Incorrect. The `\\n` is not a literal character but rather an escape character. It therefore does not literally print `\\n` to the screen."
        correct: false

    options_attributes:
      -
        answer: "`5`"
        explanation: "We have two `sum` variables in different scopes. We're logging the value of `sum` outside `doubleSum`, which is `5`."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "`9`"
        explanation: "We have two `sum` variables in different scopes. We're logging the value of `sum` outside `doubleSum`, which is not the same as the the value of `sum` inside `doubleSum`."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`18`"
        explanation: "The result of `doubleSum(5, 4)` is set to the variable `double`, which is not the variable we've logged to the console."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "It will throw an error because `sum` is being defined using `var` twice."
        explanation: "Incorrect. JavaScript has nested scopes. Please review that part of the reading."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "It will throw an error because `doubleSum` is an improper function definition."
        explanation: "Incorrect. It's defined just fine."

    options_attributes:
      -
        answer: "`3.75`"
        explanation: "The function `areMultiples` calculates whether `bigNumber` can be divided evenly by `smallNumber`. It does not divide the numbers."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`true`"
        explanation: "The function `areMultiples` calculates whether `bigNumber` can be divided evenly by `smallNumber`. `15 % 4` is `3`, because the remainder of dividing `15` by `4` is `3`. Therefore the two numbers are not multiples of each other."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`false`"
        explanation: "The function `areMultiples` calculates whether `bigNumber` can be divided evenly by `smallNumber`. `15 % 4` will not equal `0` because the two numbers are not multiples of each other."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "`areMultiples(15, 3)`"
        explanation: "JavaScript will call `areMultiples(15, 3)` and will log its value, not the string `\"areMultiples(15, 3)\"`."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "None of the options are correct."
        explanation: "Incorrect. One of them is indeed correct."

        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`2`"
        explanation: "The value of `countdown` at index `1` is `2`."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "`1`"
        explanation: "We're not logging the value `1`, but the value of `countdown` at index `1`."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`6`"
        explanation: "That's the sum of all the numbers in the array, but we're not asking it to perform an addition on any of them."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`undefined`"

        answer: "`4` then `4`"
        explanation: "The variable `length` stores the value of `seasons.length` when `seasons` is holding 3 items, and while `seasons.length` changes as we push items into `seasons`, `length` will not since it's not pointing to the same value."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`3` then `4`"
        explanation: "`seasons.length` will increase as we push items into `seasons`, but the variable `length` will not because it's pointing to a different value."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "It will throw an error when it gets to `push`."
        explanation: "Incorrect. `push` is a valid function that can be called on an Array to insert additional values into it."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`4` and then `3`"
        explanation: "The variable `length` stores the value of `seasons.length` when `seasons` is holding 3 items, and while `seasons.length` changes as we push items into `seasons`, `length` will not since it's not pointing to the same value."

        answer: "`\"Not enough for a long vacation.\"`"
        explanation: "`vacationDays` is `5`, which means it's also less than or equal to `5`, and so the first `if` statement evaluates to `true`."
        correct: true
      -
        answer: "`\"We can take a whole week off, not bad.\"`"
        explanation: "`vacationDays` is `5`, which means it's also less than or equal to `5`, and so the first `if` statement evaluates to `true` and the second statement, the `else if`, will not be evaluated regardless of whether it also is `true` or not."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`\"We're gonna have a great time!\"`"
        explanation: "`vacationDays` is `5`, therefore also less than or equal to `5`, and so the first condition will evaluate to `true` and JavaScript will not execute the `else` block."
        correct: false
      -
        answer: "`\"Not enough for a long vacation.\"` followed immediately by `\"We can take a whole week off, not bad.\"`"
        explanation: "Only one of the three branches in an if statement will ever execute."
        correct: false
      -
