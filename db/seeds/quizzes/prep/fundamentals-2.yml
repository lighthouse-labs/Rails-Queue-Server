          ```bash
          john
          paul
          george
          ringo
          ```
        explanation: "The `for` loop's counter variable, `i`, increments not by `1` but by `2` at every step, and so not every item in the array will be printed out."
        correct: false

          ```bash
          john
          george
          ```
        explanation: "The `for` loop's counter variable, `i`, starts at `0` and increments by `2` each step so only indexes `0` and `2` will be printed out."
        correct: true

          ```bash
          paul
          ringo
          ```
        explanation: "The `for` loop's counter variable, `i`, increments by `2` at each step and so will skip some items in the array, but it starts at `0`. The first item printed will be the item at index `0` in the array."
        correct: false

        answer: "Index out of bounds error"
        explanation: "The `for` loop will only continue _while_ `i` is less than the length of the array, so it will not execute the contents of the loop when it equals or goes over the length."
        correct: false

        answer: |
          ```bash
          ringo
          paul
          ```
        explanation: "The `for` loop is increasing the index as it loops through, therefore not looking at the items in reverse order."
        correct: false
